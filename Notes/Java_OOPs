# Java OOPs Notes

## 1. Basics of OOP
- OOP = Object Oriented Programming, based on objects and classes.
- Main pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

## 2. Pillars of OOP

### Encapsulation
- Binding data (variables) and methods (functions) together.
- Achieved using classes and access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).
- Example: Getters and Setters.

### Inheritance
- Mechanism to acquire properties & behavior of another class.
- `extends` keyword.
- Promotes code reusability.
- Example: `class Dog extends Animal`.

### Polymorphism
- Ability to perform one action in different ways.
- Compile-time (method overloading) and Run-time (method overriding).
- Example: Overloading `add()` with different parameter types.

### Abstraction
- Hiding implementation details, showing only functionality.
- Achieved using `abstract classes` and `interfaces`.

## 3. Interface vs Abstract Class

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Methods | Can have abstract & concrete methods | All methods are abstract (till Java 7), default/static methods from Java 8 |
| Variables | Can have instance variables | Only `public static final` (constants) |
| Inheritance | Class can extend only one abstract class | Class can implement multiple interfaces |
| Use Case | “is-a” relationship, partial abstraction | Contract/blueprint for classes |

## 4. Exception Handling
- Exceptions = runtime errors.
- Keywords: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`.
- Checked Exception: Checked at compile time (e.g., IOException).
- Unchecked Exception: Occurs at runtime (e.g., NullPointerException).

---

## 5. Important Keywords
- `this`: Refers to current object.
- `super`: Refers to parent class.
- `final`: Variable = constant, Method = cannot be overridden, Class = cannot be inherited.
- `static`: Belongs to class, not instance.
